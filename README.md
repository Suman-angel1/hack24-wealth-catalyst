## Technical Architecture

### Framework & Design Pattern:
- Developed as a Single-Page Application (SPA) using the AngularJS Framework, adhering to a Component-Driven Architecture for modularity and reusability.

### State Management:
- Centralized state management implemented using Angular Services for seamless data flow across components.

### Routing & Navigation:
- Configured Lazy-Loaded Routes for financial tools such as Goal Setter, Trade Calendar, and Trade Replay to optimize initial load performance.
- Persistent Side Navigation Menu enables quick, context-aware navigation throughout the application.

### Custom Components:
- Designed a custom event calendar module with enhanced UX to support event scheduling, reminders, and analytics integration.

## Key Functional Aspects

### Optimized Development Workflow:
- Code splitting and tree-shaking for improved bundle size and performance.
- Followed DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles to accelerate development and maintainability.

### User Experience (UX):

## Value Explanation-Hooked Model

### Trigger
- **Internal Trigger**: Users overwhelmed without a clear financial plan seek guidance.
- **External Trigger**: Notifications to set goals, engage with their trade calendar, and review trades.

### Action
- Response by setting financial goals, following daily trade tasks, and reviewing past trades.

### Reward
- **Variable Reward**: Users feel satisfied reaching milestones and gaining insights.
- **Social Reward**: Sharing achievements with peers fosters community.

### Investment
- **Commitment**: Users invest time in goals and personalized engagement, enhancing future experiences.

### Impact
- Our solution has a direct impact on activations and retention. Currently, 87% of the base is not even logging into the app, and 83% of those who do log in are not placing any trades.
- By targeting an incremental 2.5% increase in traded active users among our daily active users (DAU), we anticipate a significant uplift of ~16% in the daily order counts.
- The same impact can be seen in new user activations across segments by handholding them with a comprehensive learning journey.
- Projected rise in activation by ~2.5%. Currently, around 5% of users add funds successfully to their accounts but delay their first trade due to no guidance.
- Combining both TAU and activations impact, we can increase the revenue by ~₹264 Cr.
